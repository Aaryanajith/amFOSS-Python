# 1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
The two boolean values are `True` and `False`. The values should begin with a uppercase letter.


# 2. What are the three Boolean operators?
The three boolean operators are `and`, `or`, `not`.


#4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) == True and False == False

not (5 > 4) == not True == False

(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) == True or False == True

not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) == not (True or False) == not (True) == False

(True and True) and (True == False) == True and False == False 

(not False) or (not True) == True or False == True


# 5. What are the six comparison operators?
== - Equal to

!= - Not equal to

< - Less than

> - Greater than

<= - Less than or Equal to

>= - Greater than or Equal to

# 6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
== is the Equal to operator, it is used to check if both the values are equal. = is the assignment operator which assigns any value to a variable.


# 7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
Condition is basically a choice where we can either select any choice and that influences your output. We could use conditions everywhere and one such example is to check if we can buy a toy. The cost of the toy is 100$. The money you have is 90$. The condition would be if you can buy the toy or not. As the money you have is less than the cost of the toy, you can't buy the toy. `(money you have < cost)`.


# 8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
#spam = 0
#if spam == 10:
#    print('eggs')
#    if spam > 5:
#        print('bacon')
#    else:
#        print('ham')
#    print('spam')
#print('spam')

The three blocks in this code are:  

if spam == 10:
	print('eggs')
	
if spam > 5:
	print('bacon')
	
else:
	print('ham')
	
	
#9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

# 10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
We can press `Ctrl+c` to exit the loop if your program is stuck in an infinite loop.


# 11. What is the difference between break and continue?
Break exits from the loop and the program continues from the next line while continue makes the iteration go to the next iteration.

# 12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
There is no difference in all three range functions as all return the same value.


# 13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# 14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
We should call as `spam.bacon()`. This will help us use the function
